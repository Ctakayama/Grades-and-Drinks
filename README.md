Data Science project for COGS 108 at UCSD Spring 2020. 


As a group of college students, our group wanted to answer a question that was relatable to us. We wanted to see if there was any correlation between a students drinking habits and their academic performance in school. We analyzed the daily and weekend drinking habits of students in Portugal, creating visuals and running linear regression tests on certain variables. Our visuals showed a direct correlation between drinking habits and academic performance, but our linear regression tests seemed to negate the results of these visuals.
